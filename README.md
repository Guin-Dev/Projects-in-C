# Projects-in-C
All my ongoing and completed projects in the C language.

Here you will find all my projects that I have done in the C language, including projects that are still in development, such as "X-insider".

Every project will contain:
- Compilation and execution line;
- Requirements (if any);
- Instruction and use manual;
- Status;
- Creation and Completion Date;
